# Vite + Bootstrap Project

## Description

This project combines the modern build tool Vite with Bootstrap for styling, featuring simple routing for a straightforward single-page application (SPA) architecture. It's dockerized to streamline setup and ensure a consistent development environment, making it easy to get started without managing dependencies and configurations.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have Docker installed on your machine. Docker is used to containerize the application, ensuring a smooth and consistent environment for development and deployment.

- [Get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

## Installation and Setup

To set up and run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vite-bootstrap-app.git
   cd vite-bootstrap-app
   ```

2. **Build the Docker image**

   This step compiles your application into a Docker image, making it ready to run on any machine with Docker.

   ```bash
   docker build -t vite-app .
   ```

3. **Run the Docker container**

   Start a container from the image. This command runs the application and forwards the necessary port:

   ```bash
   docker run --network="host" -p 5173:5173 vite-app
   ```

After running these steps, the application should be accessible at `http://localhost:5173/`.

## Usage

The application features simple routing and Bootstrap styling, ideal for starting a new project or as a basis for learning. Navigate through the app to see the basic setup in action, with routes and components ready for expansion.
